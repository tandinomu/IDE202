# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Overview
- **Definition**: RNNs are a class of neural networks designed for processing sequential data. They have connections that allow information to persist, making them suitable for tasks where context is important.

## Key Features
**Sequence Data**: RNNs are effective for tasks involving sequences, such as time series, text, and speech.
 
#### Examples of Sequence Data

1. **Speech Recognition**
   - Converts spoken language into text.
   - RNNs remember past audio frames for better context, aiding in recognizing words across different pronunciations and accents.
   - They can predict phonemes from audio features to construct words and sentences.

2. **Music Generation**
   - Involves creating new music compositions using AI.
   - RNNs learn musical patterns (like chord progressions) to generate melodies that mimic learned styles.
   - They can produce original pieces that reflect the characteristics of the training data, assisting composers and musicians.

3. **Sentiment Classification**
   - Determines the emotional tone behind text.
   - RNNs process sequential text data, capturing context to understand variations like negation.
   - They learn dependencies between words to identify sentiment effectively.

4. **Video Analysis**
   - Interprets information from video sequences for applications like surveillance and activity recognition.
   - RNNs analyze temporal dynamics, tracking motion and actions across frames.
   - They recognize patterns that correspond to specific activities, enhancing understanding of events.

5. **Language Translation**
   - Converts text from one language to another, requiring context and grammatical understanding.
   - RNNs use a sequence-to-sequence framework to encode and decode sentences.
   - They maintain contextual information to ensure accurate translations across varying sentence lengths.
   
   
## How is RNN different from other Neural Networks?

## Structure

### 1. Basic Components:
- **Input Layer:** Takes in sequential data, like words in a sentence.
- **Hidden Layer:** Contains units (neurons) that maintain the hidden state, processing input data at each time step and updating the hidden state based on the current input and the previous hidden state.
- **Output Layer:**  Generates results at each step, which can be a single prediction (like a class label) or a sequence (like translated words).

### 2. Hidden State:
- The hidden state acts as the network's memory, carrying information from previous time steps. It allows the RNN to consider context when processing sequential data.
- At time step \( t \), the hidden state \( h_t \) is calculated as:
  \[
  h_t = f(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b)
  \]
  Where:
  - \( W_h \): Weight matrix for the hidden state.
  - \( W_x \): Weight matrix for the input.
  - \( b \): Bias vector.
  - \( f \): Activation function (often tanh or ReLU).


### 3. Recurrent Connections:
-RNNs have connections that let them remember what they learned from the last step. This means that as they read each word, they can keep track of the important information from the previous words. 

## How RNNs Work

### 1. Data Processing:
- RNNs process data sequentially, reading one element at a time. For instance, in a sentence, they process each word in order, updating their hidden state as they go.

### 2. Hidden State Update:
- At each time step, the RNN updates its hidden state based on the current input \( x_t \) and the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \). This allows the network to "remember" information from prior inputs, which is crucial for tasks where context matters.

### 3. Output Generation:
- After updating the hidden state, the RNN generates an output \( y_t \) based on the current hidden state:
  \[
  y_t = W_y h_t + b_y
  \]
  Where:
  - \( W_y \): Weight matrix for the output.
  - \( b_y \): Bias for the output.

### 4. Training with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):
RNNs learn by using Backpropagation Through Time. This means they look back at each step in the sequence to see how well they did.

First, they figure out the loss based on their predictions. Then, they adjust their weights to improve for the next time.

## Example:# Governing Parameters of RNNs

The weights in a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are indeed critical governing parameters. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

## 1. Weights
Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, which determines how much influence one neuron has on another. In RNNs, there are typically weights for:

- **Input-to-Hidden Weights**: These weights connect the input layer to the hidden layer.
- **Hidden-to-Hidden Weights**: These weights connect the hidden layer at the current time step to the hidden layer at the next time step, allowing the network to maintain a form of memory.
- **Hidden-to-Output Weights**: These weights connect the hidden layer to the output layer, determining how the hidden state influences the final output.

## 2. Biases
Each neuron often has an associated bias term that helps the model learn by allowing it to fit the data more flexibly.

Together, the weights and biases are adjusted during training through backpropagation to minimize the loss function. They are essential for capturing the relationships in the data, especially for tasks involving sequences and time dependencies.


### Example 1

### Sequential Input:
In the sentence "I love programming," the RNN processes each word one after the other.

### Hidden State:
As it reads each word, the RNN maintains a "hidden state," which acts like memory. This hidden state gets updated with every new word, allowing the network to remember previous words and their context.

### Processing Words:
When it reads "I," it updates its memory to remember that. When it reads "love," it updates its memory again to include both "I" and "love." By the time it gets to "programming," it knows the entire context of the sentence.

### Making Predictions:
After processing the whole sentence, the RNN can make predictions based on its memory. For example, if you ask what comes next after "I love programming," it might predict "because it is fun."

### Training:
RNNs learn by adjusting their memory and how they process words based on examples. They use a Backpropagation Through Time to improve their predictions over time.

### Example 2 

He said, 'Teddy bear on sale!'. For this example we do not use simple rnn. We use **Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network** 


### Hidden States
A bidirectional RNN processes the input in two directions—forward (left to right) and backward (right to left)—allowing it to capture context from both sides.

### Processing Words
### Forward Pass
- Reads "He," then "said," updating its memory with the context.

### Backward Pass
- Reads "sale," then "on," adding context from the end of the sentence back to the start.

### Making Predictions
After processing, the BiRNN can make predictions based on complete context. For example, it might predict something related to the teddy bear after "He said."

### Training
Bidirectional RNNs learn through Backpropagation Through Time for both directions, refining their predictions over time.

# Forward Propagation

Forward propagation is the process by which input data is passed through the network to generate an output.

## Hidden State Calculation

At each time step \( t \), the hidden state \( h_t \) is computed as follows:

\[
h_t = \sigma(W_{ih} x_t + W_{hh} h_{t-1} + b_h)
\]

Where:

- \( x_t \) is the input at time step \( t \).
- \( W_{ih} \) is the input-to-hidden weight matrix.
- \( W_{hh} \) is the hidden-to-hidden weight matrix.
- \( b_h \) is the bias for the hidden layer.
- \( \sigma \) is the activation function (e.g., tanh or ReLU).

## Output Calculation

The output \( y_t \) at time step \( t \) is calculated as:

\[
y_t = W_{ho} h_t + b_o
\]

Where:

- \( W_{ho} \) is the hidden-to-output weight matrix.
- \( b_o \) is the bias for the output layer.

# Backward Propagation

Backward propagation is the process used to train the network by adjusting the weights and biases based on the error of the output.

## Loss Calculation

The loss \( L \) is computed using a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification):

\[
L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} \text{loss}(y_t, \hat{y}_t)
\]

Where \( \hat{y}_t \) is the predicted output.

## Types of RNNs

### 1. One-to-One RNN
This is the simplest form where a single input corresponds to a single output.
- **How It Works**: Imagine you have a single input, like an image. The RNN processes that image and predicts one label for it, like “cat” or “dog.”
- **Example**: Classifying a single image into a category. You input the image, and the output is a single class label.

### 2. One-to-Many RNN
A single input produces a sequence of outputs.
- **How It Works**:  You start with one input (like a short melody), and the RNN generates several musical notes over time.
- **Example**: If the input is a simple melody, like “C, C, G, G, A, A, G,” the model can produce a longer piece of music that continues from that, such as “C, C, G, G, A, A, G, F, F, E, E, D, D, C.” This shows how one input can lead to many musical notes.

### 3. Many-to-One RNN
Multiple inputs are processed to generate a single output.

- **How It Works**: You input a sequence of data (like a sentence), and the RNN analyzes the whole sequence to produce one result, like whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
- **Example**: Analyzing a movie review where you input a series of words. The RNN processes the entire review and outputs one sentiment score, like “positive.”

### 4. Many-to-Many RNN
This type takes a sequence of inputs and produces a sequence of outputs.
- **How It Works**: While translating a sentence from one language to another. Each word in the input sentence corresponds to a word in the output sentence.
- **Example**: You input a sentence in Hindi, and the RNN translates it word by word into English. The input and output are both sequences of words.

- **Speech-to-Text**: RNNs transcribe audio recordings into written text, which is useful for transcription services and accessibility features.

### 4. Music Generation
- **Composition**: RNNs can create new music pieces by learning patterns from existing songs. This can be used in music production or to assist musicians in creativity.

### 5. Video Analysis
- **Action Recognition**: RNNs analyze video frames to identify actions (like running or jumping), which is useful in surveillance and entertainment (like video games).

- **Video Captioning**: RNNs can generate descriptive captions for video content, making it easier to understand what’s happening in a video.

### 6. Robotics
- **Control Systems**: RNNs learn from sequences of data to control robotic movements, making them more responsive and adaptable in real-time environments.
